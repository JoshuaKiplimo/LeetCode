## Method 1. One Pass
Key Points:
1. Use a variable to track and store the minimum price.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices==null || prices.length<2) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int price: prices) {
            if(price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price;
            } else {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
            }
        }
        return (maxProfit == Integer.MIN_VALUE) ? 0 : maxProfit;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : O(n). Only a single pass is needed.        
2. Space complexity : O(1). Only two variables are used.
