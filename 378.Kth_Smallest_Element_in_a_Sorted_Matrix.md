## Method 1. Min-Heap 
If you think about it, we can reframe the problem as finding the K-th smallest elements from amongest `N sorted lists` right.       
[可以将问题简化为，从 N 个 sorted lists 中找到 K-th smallest elements.]

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        int N = matrix.length;
        PriorityQueue<HeapNode> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<HeapNode>(Math.min(N, k), new Comparator<HeapNode>() {
            public int compare(HeapNode x, HeapNode y) {
                return x.value - y.value;
            }
        });
        
        // Preparing our min-heap
        for(int r=0; r<Math.min(N, k); r++) {
            // Add triplets of information of each cell
            minHeap.offer(new HeapNode(matrix[r][0], r, 0));
        }
        
        HeapNode element = minHeap.peek();
        while(k-- > 0) {
            // Extract-Min
            element = minHeap.poll();
            int r = element.getRow();
            int c = element.getCol();
            
            // If we have any new elements in the current row, and add them
            if(c < N - 1) {
                minHeap.offer(new HeapNode(matrix[r][c+1], r, c+1));
            }
        }
        return element.getValue();
    }
}


class HeapNode {
    int value;
    int row;
    int col;
    
    public HeapNode(int v, int r, int c) {
        value = v;
        row = r;
        col = c;
    }
    
    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
    
    public int getRow() {
        return row;
    }
    
    public int getCol() {
        return col;
    }
}
```


## Method 2. Binary Search
Since each row and column of the matrix is sorted, is it possible to use Binary Search to find the `Kth` smallest number? 
The biggest problem to use Binary Search in this case is that we don’t have a straightforward sorted array, instead we have a matrix.

In a sorted matrix, we can't really find a middle. Even if we do consider some `index` as middle, it is not straightforward to find the search space containing numbers bigger or smaller than the number pointed out by the middle index.      
An alternate could be to apply the Binary Search on the `number range` instead of the `index range`. As we know that the smallest number of our matrix is at the top left corner and the biggest number is at the bottom lower corner. These two number can represent the `range` i.e., the start and the end for the Binary Search.
