## Method 1. Depth-First Search, Recursion
> If you simply consider the depth first traversal on a tree, all it does is traverse once branch after another.
> All we need to do here is to simply execute the depth first traversal and maintain two things along the way:
> 1. A running sum of all the nodes traversed till that point in recursion and
> 2. A list of all those nodes. 
```java 
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
        List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        recurseTree(root, sum, path, res);
        return res;
    }
    
    private void recurseTree(TreeNode node, int sum, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> res) {
        if(node == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        // Add the current node to the path
        path.add(node.val);
        
        // Check is the current node is a leaf and if the val of current node equals the remaining sum.
        // If it does, then we add the path to the res
        if(sum == node.val && node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            res.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        } else {
            // Else, we will recurse on the left and the right children
            recurseTree(node.left, sum - node.val, path, res);
            recurseTree(node.right, sum - node.val, path, res);
        }
        // We need to pop the node once we done processing all of its subtrees.
        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

Complexity:

    Time Complexity: O(N^2) where NNN are the number of nodes in a tree. In the worst case, we could have a complete binary tree and if that is the case, then there would be N/2 leafs.
    Space Complexity: O(N). The space complexity, like many other problems is debatable here.
