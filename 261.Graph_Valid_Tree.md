也就是判断是否有环存在，若有环则说明不是一棵树。

## Method 1. Union Find
* If there is a cycle, then it isn't a valid tree;
* After adding all edges, if there have more than one roots, then it isn't a valid tree.
```java 
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Initialize the root forest
        int[] roots = new int[n];
        int[] rank = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            roots[i] = i;
        }
        
        
        for(int[] edge: edges) {
            int root1 = find(roots, edge[0]);
            int root2 = find(roots, edge[1]);
            if(root1 == root2) {
                return false;
            }
            if(rank[root1] < rank[root2]) {
                roots[root1] = root2;
            } else if(rank[root1] > rank[root2]) {
                roots[root2] = root1;
            } else {
                roots[root1] = root2;
                rank[root2]++;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return n == 1;  // Make sure just one root
    }
    
    private int find(int[] roots, int id) {
        if(id != roots[id]) {
            roots[id] = find(roots, roots[id]);
        }
        return roots[id];
    }
}
```


## Method 2. Graph Theory + Iterative Depth-First Search
Recall that a graph, `G`, **is a tree iff** the following two conditions are met:
1. `G` is a fully connected. In other words, for every pair of nodes in `G`, there is a path between them;
2. `G` contains no cycles. In other words, there is exactly *one* path between each pair of nodes in `G`.

**Depth-First Search** is a classic graph-traversal algorithm that can be used to check for both of these conditions:
1. `G` is fully connected if, and only if, we started a depth-first search from a single source and discovered *all* nodes in `G` during it.
2. `G` contains no cycles if, and only if, the depth-first search never goes back to an already discovered node.
We need to be careful though not to count trivial cycles of the form `A -> B -> A` that occur with most implementations of undirected edges.

There are graph representations:
1. An **adjacency list**. An **adjacency list** is where we have a list of sub-lists, where each sub-list is the list of the immediate neighbors of the i-th node.
2. An **adjacency matrix**. Often, we'd only use an adjacency matrix if we *know* that the number of edges is substantially higher thanthe number of nodes.
3. A **linked representation**, where you make actual nodes objects, would be an overly complicated representation and could suggest to an interviewer that you have a limited understanding of adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

The first step is to convert the input into an **adjacency list**. 
1. **If the graph is fully connected,** then every node must have been seen. This means that all nodes must be in the `seen` set at the end.
```java 
# Return true if and only if the depth first search discovered all nodes.
return seen.size() == n;
```
2. 

```java 
class Solution {
    public boolean validTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
        for(int[] edge: edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> parent = new HashMap<>();
        parent.put(0, -1);
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        stack.push(0);
        
        while(!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int node = stack.pop();
            for(int nei: graph.get(node)) {
                if(parent.get(node) == nei) {
                    continue;
                }
                if(parent.containsKey(nei)) {
                    return false;
                }
                stack.push(nei);
                parent.put(nei, node);
            }
        }
        return parent.size() == n;
    }
}
``` 


## Method 3. Advanced Graph Theory + Iterative Depth-First Search
> For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have *exactly* `n-1` edges.
> Any less, and it can't possibly be fully connected.
> Any more, and it has to contain a cycle.
> Additionally, if the graph is fully connected and contains *exactly* `n-1` edges, it can't possibly contain a cycle, and therefore must be a tree!
