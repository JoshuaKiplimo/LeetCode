## Method 1. Dynamic Programming with Binary Search
We use an array to store the increasing subsequence formed by including the currently encountered element.
While traversing the nums array, we keep on filling the array with the elements encountered so far.
```java 
input: [0, 8, 4, 12, 2]
dp: [0]
dp: [0, 8]
dp: [0, 4]
dp: [0, 4, 12]
dp: [0 , 2, 12] which is not the longest increasing subsequence, but length of dpdpdp array results in length of Longest Increasing Subsequence.
```
也就是每次遇到一个 num，将其插入的合适的位置。

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        int idx = 0;
        for(int num: nums) {
            int i = Arrays.binarySearch(dp, 0, idx, num);
            if(i < 0) {
                i = -(i + 1);
            }
            dp[i] = num;
            if(i == idx) {
                idx++;
            }
        }
        return idx;
    }
}
```
