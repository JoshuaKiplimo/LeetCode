## Method 1. One Pass
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<prices.length; i++) {
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                profit += (prices[i] - prices[i-1]);
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis
1. Time complexity : O(n). Single pass.
2. Space complexity: O(1). Constant space needed.


## Method 2. Peak Valley Approach
![](images/122_maxprofit_1.PNG)
* `TotalProfit = Sum(height(peak_i) - height(valley_i))`
Key Points:
1. `while(i < prices.length - 1)`, if `i < prices.length`, then this will fall into dead-loop.
2. Always compare to the next value to find peak and valley.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int valley = prices[0];
        int peak = prices[0];
        int i = 0;
        while(i < prices.length - 1) {
            while(i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] >= prices[i+1]) {
                i++;
            }   // after the while-loop, prices[i] >= prices[i+1]
            valley = prices[i];
            while(i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i+1]) {
                i++;
            }   // after the while-loop, prices[i] > prices[i+1]
            peak = prices[i];
            profit += (peak - valley);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
