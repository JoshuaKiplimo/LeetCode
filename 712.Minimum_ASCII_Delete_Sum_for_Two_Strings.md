## Method 1. Dynamic Programming
Let `dp[i][j]` be the answer to the problem for the strings `s1[i:]` and `s2[j:]`.
```java 
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeleteSum(String s1, String s2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        
        // s2.length, s2[3:], which means that s2 is empty, we need to delete all 
        for(int i=s1.length()-1; i>=0; i--) {
            dp[i][s2.length()] = dp[i+1][s2.length()] + s1.codePointAt(i);
        }
        // s1.length, s1[3:], which means that s1 is empty, we need add all element is s2.
        for(int j=s2.length()-1; j>=0; j--) {
            dp[s1.length()][j] = dp[s1.length()][j+1] + s2.codePointAt(j);
        }
        
        for(int i=s1.length()-1; i>=0; i--) {
            for(int j=s2.length()-1; j>=0; j--) {
                if(s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1];
                } else {    // s1[i]!=s2[j], we will have to delete at least one of them.
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i+1][j] + s1.codePointAt(i),
                                       dp[i][j+1] + s2.codePointAt(j));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
