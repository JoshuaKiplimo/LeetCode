* Hint: We can think of this problem as a shortest path problem on a graph: there are 10000 nodes (string "0000" to "9999"),
and there is an edge between two nodes if they differ in on digit, that differs by 1 (wrapping around, so '0' and '9' differ by 1),
and if **both** nodes are not in `deadends`.
