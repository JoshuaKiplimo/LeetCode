## Method 1. Dynamic Programming
> We make use of a `dp` array where i-th element of `dp` represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at i-th index. 
> We initialize the complete `dp` array with 0's. 
> Now, it's obvious that the valid substrings must end with ‘)’. 
> This further leads to the conclusion that the substrings ending with ‘(’ will always contain '0' at their corresponding `dp` indices. 
> Thus, we update the `dp` array only when ‘)’ is encountered.

> To fill `dp` array we will check every two consecutive characters of the string and if
> 1. `s[i] = ')'` and `s[i-1] = '('`, i.e. the string looks like "...()" ==> `dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2`. We do so because the ending "()" portion is a valid substring anyhow and leads to an increment of 2 in the length of the just previous valid substring's length.
> 2. `s[i] = ')'` and `s[i-1] = ')'`, i.e. the string looks like "...))" ==> if `s[i-dp[i-1]-1] = '('` then `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-dp[i-1]-2]+2`. 
> This is because the second last ')' was a part of a valid substring `subs`, for the last ')' to be a part of larger substring, there must be a corresponding starting '(' which lies before the valid substring of the which the 2nd last ')'.

                if(s.charAt(i-1)=='(') {
                    dp[i] = (i >= 2 ? dp[i-2] : 0) + 2;
                } else if(i-dp[i-1]>0 && s.charAt(i-dp[i-1]-1)=='(') {
                    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-dp[i-1]-2 >= 0 ? dp[i-dp[i-1]-2] : 0) + 2;
                }
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dp[i]);

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(n). Single traversal of string to fill dp array is done.
    Space complexity : O(n). dp array of size n is used.
