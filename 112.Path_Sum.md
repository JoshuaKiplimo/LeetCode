从 `root` 到某个 `leaf` 的路径和等于某个给定的值。

## Method 1. Recursion

```java 
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if(root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        sum -= root.val;
        if((root.left == null) && (root.right == null)) {
            return sum == 0;
        }
        
        return hasPathSum(root.left, sum) || hasPathSum(root.right, sum);
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis
    Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
    Space complexity : in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log⁡(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log⁡(N)). 
  
  
## Method 2. Iterations
> The idea is to visit each node with the DFS strategy, while updating the remaining sum to cumulate at each visit.

```java
