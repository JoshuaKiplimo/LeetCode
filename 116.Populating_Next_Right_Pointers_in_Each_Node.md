## Method 1. Level Order Traversal
```java 
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node next;

    public Node() {}
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, Node _left, Node _right, Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};

class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>(){{
            offer(root);
        }};
        // Outer loop which iterates over each level
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            // Iterate over all the nodes on the current level
            for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {
                // Pop a node from the front of the queue
                Node node = queue.poll();
                // This check is important. 
                // We don't want to establish any wrong connections.
                // The queue will contain ndoes from 2 levels at most at any point in time.
                // This check ensures we don't establish next pointers beyong the end of a level
                if(i < size - 1) {
                    node.next = queue.peek();
                }
                
                // Add the children, if any, to the back of the queue
                if(node.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(node.left);
                }
                if(node.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(node.right);
                }
            }
        }
        // Since the tree has now been modified, return the root node
        return root;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N) since we process each node exactly once. Note that processing a node in this context means popping the node from the queue and then establishing the next pointers.
    Space Complexity: O(N). This is a perfect binary tree which means the last level contains N/2 nodes. The space complexity for breadth first traversal is the space occupied by the queue which is dependent upon the maximum number of nodes in particular level. So, in this case, the space complexity would be O(N). 


## Method 2. Using previously established next pointers
> 1. This first case is the one where we establish the next pointers between the two children of a given node.[如果两个 Node 有相同的 parent] ==> `node.left.next = node.right`
> 2. This next case is not too straightforward to handle. The next pointer between nodes having different parents is not trivial. ==> `node.right.next = node.next.left`
```java 
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        // Start with the root node.
        // There are next pointers that need to be set up on the first level
        Node leftMost = root;
        
        // Once we reach the final level, we are done
        while(leftMost.left != null) {
            Node head = leftMost;
            while(head != null) {
                // Connection 1:
                head.left.next = head.right;
                // Connection 2:
                if(head.next != null) {
                    head.right.next = head.next.left;
                }
                // Progress along the list (nodes on the current level)
                head = head.next;
            }
            // Move onto the next level
            leftMost = leftMost.left;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N) since we process each node exactly once.
    Space Complexity: O(1) since we don't make use of any additional data structure for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.
