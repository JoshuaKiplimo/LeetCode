## Method 1. Top Down Depth-first Search
Key Points:
1. **Binary Tree** is different with **Binary Search Tree**.
2. A top-down approach is similar to an in-order traversal.
3. We use a variable `length` to store the current consecutive path length and pass it down the tree.
4. As we traverse, we compare the current node with its parent node to determine if it is consecutive or not.

```java
class Solution {
    private int maxLen = 0;
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, null, 0);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode curr, TreeNode parent, int length) {
        if(curr == null) {
            return;
        }
        length = (parent != null && curr.val == parent.val + 1) ? length + 1 : 1;
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, length);
        dfs(curr.left, curr, length);
        dfs(curr.right, curr, length);
    }
}
```
Complexity analysis
1. Time complexity : `O(n)`. The time complexity is the same as an in-order traversal of a binary tree with nnn nodes.
2. Space complexity : `O(n)`. The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. For a skewed binary tree, 
the recursion could go up to `n` levels deep.


## Method 2. Bottom Up Depth-first Search
* The bottom-up approach is similar to a post-order traversal. We return the consecutive path length starting at current node to its parent.
```java
class Solution {
    private int maxLen = 0;
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxLen;
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode curr) {
        if(curr == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int L = dfs(curr.left) + 1;
        int R = dfs(curr.right) + 1;
        if(curr.left != null && curr.val + 1 != curr.left.val) {
            L = 1;
        }
        if(curr.right != null && curr.val + 1 != curr.right.val) {
            R = 1;
        }
        int len = Math.max(L, R);
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, len);
        return len;
    }
}
```
